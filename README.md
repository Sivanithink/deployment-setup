## installing dependencies ,running them , ideal folder structure
### React.Js 
- for  react.Js environment  we need node.js and npm
- node.js is used beacause it allow to us execute a code outside a browser 
- npm is a package manager for node which makes easy to install libraries and tools 
- after installing node and npm we can verify by running node -v  npm -v 
- Setting up a New React.js Project 
- npx create-react-app my-app
- This command create a new React app named my-app and by cd my-app we will navigate to project folder . 
- by running this command the project structure will be created 
- the root folder will have package.json,package-lock.json,public and src(will have key files)
- npm start
- this comand wiil launch the develo[ment server and browser will open here we will see the react.js app

### .Net 
- go to official website and download the latest version of .Net and install it 
- if we want to verify and know .Net version run 'dotnet --version'
- dotnet new console -o nithin 
- This command will create an empty project with all the  packages required to run the .NET project. here -o tells to create the new project inside a folder called nithin

### Angular 
- same as like react the angular aslo requires node.js and npm 
- we check them by node -v and npm -v  
- 'npm install -g @angular/cli'
-  angular CLI is used for initializing ,developing and maintaining angular applications
-  we run this command to install angular CLI globally in our system
- ng new angular-nithin
- ng is like angular assistant after installing angular cli we can use ng to create,serve,build,test for angular project
- we need to choose our own angular routing and styling while creating new project which suits correctly
